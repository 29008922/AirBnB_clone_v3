For this project you will fork this codebase:

Update the repository name to AirBnB_clone_v3
Update the README.md:
Add yourself as an author of the project
Add new information about your new contribution
Make it better!
If you’re the owner of this codebase, create a new repository called AirBnB_clone_v3 and copy over all files from AirBnB_clone_v2
Since the beginning we’ve been using the unittest module, but do you know why unittests are so important? Because when you add a new feature, you refactor a piece of code, etc… you want to be sure you didn’t break anything.

At Holberton, we have a lot of tests, and they all pass! Just for the Intranet itself, there are:

5,213 assertions (as of 08/20/2018)
13,061 assertions (as of 01/25/2021)
The following requirements must be met for your project:

all current tests must pass (don’t delete them…)
add new tests as much as you can (tests are mandatory for some tasks)
Update DBStorage and FileStorage, adding two new methods. All changes should be done in the branch storage_get_count:

A method to retrieve one object:

Prototype: def get(self, cls, id):
cls: class
id: string representing the object ID
Returns the object based on the class and its ID, or None if not found
A method to count the number of objects in storage:

Prototype: def count(self, cls=None):
cls: class (optional)
Returns the number of objects in storage matching the given class. If no class is passed, returns the count of all objects in storage.
Don’t forget to add new tests for these 2 methods on each storage engine.
It’s time to start your API!

Your first endpoint (route) will be to return the status of your API:
Magic right? (No need to have a pretty rendered output, it’s a JSON, only the structure is important)

Ok, let starts:

Create a folder api at the root of the project with an empty file __init__.py
Create a folder v1 inside api:
create an empty file __init__.py
create a file app.py:
create a variable app, instance of Flask
import storage from models
import app_views from api.v1.views
register the blueprint app_views to your Flask instance app
declare a method to handle @app.teardown_appcontext that calls storage.close()
inside if __name__ == "__main__":, run your Flask server (variable app) with:
host = environment variable HBNB_API_HOST or 0.0.0.0 if not defined
port = environment variable HBNB_API_PORT or 5000 if not defined
threaded=True
Create a folder views inside v1:
create a file __init__.py:
import Blueprint from flask doc
create a variable app_views which is an instance of Blueprint (url prefix must be /api/v1)
wildcard import of everything in the package api.v1.views.index => PEP8 will complain about it, don’t worry, it’s normal and this file (v1/views/__init__.py) won’t be check.
create a file index.py
import app_views from api.v1.views
create a route /status on the object app_views that returns a JSON: "status": "OK" (see example)
Create an endpoint that retrieves the number of each objects by type:

In api/v1/views/index.py
Route: /api/v1/stats
You must use the newly added count() method from storage
